I am a Master student of International Relations in [School of International Relations and Public Affairs]<https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn/> at [Fudan University]<https://www.fudan.edu.cn/> in Shanghai.I received my Bachelor in [Political Science and Public Administration]<https://appa.swupl.edu.cn/zzxy.htm> from [Southwest University of Political Science and Law]<https://www.swupl.edu.cn/>  in 2016.

My substantive research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and comparative politics, with a specialization in political violence, particularly violence among the elites, as well as its political and economic consequences in the developing countries.
