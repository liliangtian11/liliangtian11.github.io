I am a Master student of International Relations in [School of International Relations and Public Affairs][1] at [Fudan University][2]in Shanghai.I received my Bachelor in [Political Science and Public Administration][3] from [Southwest University of Political Science and Law][4] in 2016.

My substantive research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and comparative politics, with a specialization in political violence, particularly violence among the elites, as well as its political and economic consequences in the developing countries.
